## The Greta Base Terraforming Colony has not made contact in six months. 
### The Company has hired the crew to:
1. Rendezvous with 2ndLt Kaplan, the marine commander of the colony, and assist them
2. in repairing the situation.
3. Re-establish satellite communications and get the terraformer back online.
4. If all else fails, evacuate Dr. Edem, the mission specialist, as well as the colony’s synthetic science officer, Hinton (or at least retrieve his logic core).
	1. *The Company strongly implies the lives* of the other colonists are not a concern.


#### **The Company provides:** two months
of Salary, one month of Hazard Pay,
transportation to and from Samsa VI, as
well as one hazard suit, an SMG (with 3
magazines), a first aid kit and a stimpak per crew member.


### What’s going on?
Before taking over the Tower (pg. 20),
Hinton  experimented with the **Shriek** on
the colonists at Greta Base. Several of them
were infected. The first one to transform was
LCpl Xavier, during PFC Olsson’s birthday
celebration.
A slaughter ensued, and the surviving
colonists evacuated to the Heron
Terraforming Station (pg. 16). The few
infected remain at Greta Base, lurking the
halls in a sad interpretation of their carcinid
hive mind “orders.”
All but emergency power is out, and a
powerful tropical storm is rolling in...
